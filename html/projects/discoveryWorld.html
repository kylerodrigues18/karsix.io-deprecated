            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                As part of a collaboration with MSOE and Discovery World, my team and I analyzed
                one of Discovery World’s science and technology experiences since they anticipated
                redesigning a few of their exhibits in the future. Given a two week deadline my team
                was tasked to provide an analysis paper on one of their exhibits and give User Experience
                recommendations on what could be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Challenged with having to analyze both the exhibit in person and the website,
                we decided to split the work up based on our teams strengths. Being a computer science
                major with some experience in the front end web development, I personally took charge
                of analyzing the exhibits web site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using criteria that my group and I came up with, I analyzed Discovery Worlds
                Virtual Explorer exhibit web site and specifically looked at the sites
                Behavioral/Experience Design, the Usability of the web site and look for specific
                opportunities and recommendations that I could provide for Discovery World.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before moving on, I should explain what some of the topics I just mentioned mean and why
                they are significant.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first topic is behavioral and experience design. It is the study of how design influences 
                human behavior and how designers can manipulate user behavior. A good example of this is mobile 
                games. Many mobile games include significant UX behavioral and experience design to influence 
                users to get addicted to the game and spend money. They do this by making the game easier at 
                first, and then slowly ramping up the difficulty all while providing rewards for the user playing 
                the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another topic that I will mention in my analysis is the importance of understanding and 
                curiosity. Understanding and curiosity are considered to be motivators in UX. They can be 
                used through UX design to psychologically keep users engaged (or disengaged) in a web page or 
                app. You may remember when your favorite app or website completely redid its interface/features 
                without telling you and you got angry or confused as to why they changed the app/website. 
                Additionally you may have seen a recent trailer for an upcoming movie and already pre ordered 
                tickets because the trailer was that good and you couldn’t wait to see it. These two examples 
                resulted in two different scenarios, one where the user was confused and angry because they 
                did not understand what was happening, the other where the user was excited and interested because 
                they were curious about the film. UX designers have to know how to use understanding and curiosity 
                along with other motivators to influence user psychology and make users feel, think and do stuff on 
                purpose.

            <h2>Project Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                My team and I provide a solid analysis of the exhibit and we felt that we
                provided substantial User Experience recommendations on how the exhibit and
                website could be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, I had to learn more about website design and how
                User Experience design relates to it so that I could analyze the Discovery World
                exhibit website to understand what flaws were on it and what recommendations I
                could give to improve the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to revisit my knowledge of Behavioral and Experience Design so that I
                could analyze more than the website’s User Interface. With this knowledge I
                was able to analyze how the webpage created Understanding and Curiosity, and
                how the webpage used certain techniques to help the user remember information.
                I also gave recommendations on how Discovery World could further improve these
                topics since User Experience is a continuous process and everything can be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, I quickly realized how little I thought about User Experience
                when I am creating front end applications, and how I could create much better
                apps with a more thorough and in depth analysis. For example, I learned about
                a process called Guerrilla Usability testing. In this process an individual
                gathers user feedback by taking a design, like a mobile app or website, and
                asks 3-5 random people for their thoughts about certain aspects of the app,
                like workflow or a certain design. It is a quick and cheap way to get feedback
                about the User Experience and Design of an app. I personally used Guerrilla
                Usability testing to analyze my website, because I was too involved in the
                project and having new sets of eyes could only help me with creating a better website.
