            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                As part of a collaboration with MSOE and Discovery World, my team and I analyzed
                one of Discovery World’s science and technology experiences since they anticipated
                redesigning a few of their exhibits in the future. Given a two week deadline my team
                was tasked to provide an analysis paper on one of their exhibits and give User Experience
                recommendations on what could be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Challenged with having to analyze both the exhibit in person and the website,
                we decided to split the work up based on our teams strengths. Being a computer science
                major with some experience in the front end web development, I personally took charge
                of analyzing the exhibits web site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using criteria that my group and I came up with, I analyzed Discovery Worlds
                Virtual Explorer exhibit web site and specifically looked at the sites
                Behavioral/Experience Design, the Usability of the web site and look for specific
                opportunities and recommendations that I could provide for Discovery World.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                My team and I provide a solid analysis of the exhibit and we felt that we
                provided substantial User Experience recommendations on how the exhibit and
                website could be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, I had to learn more about website design and how
                User Experience design relates to it so that I could analyze the Discovery World
                exhibit website to understand what flaws were on it and what recommendations I
                could give to improve the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to revisit my knowledge of Behavioral and Experience Design so that I
                could analyze more than the website’s User Interface. With this knowledge I
                was able to analyze how the webpage created Understanding and Curiosity, and
                how the webpage used certain techniques to help the user remember information.
                I also gave recommendations on how Discovery World could further improve these
                topics since User Experience is a continuous process and everything can be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, I quickly realized how little I thought about User Experience
                when I am creating front end applications, and how I could create much better
                apps with a more thorough and in depth analysis. For example, I learned about
                a process called Guerrilla Usability testing. In this process an individual
                gathers user feedback by taking a design, like a mobile app or website, and
                asks 3-5 random people for their thoughts about certain aspects of the app,
                like workflow or a certain design. It is a quick and cheap way to get feedback
                about the User Experience and Design of an app. I personally used Guerrilla
                Usability testing to analyze my website, because I was too involved in the
                project and having new sets of eyes could only help me with creating a better website.
