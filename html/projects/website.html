            <h2>Karsix.io - What and Why</h2>

                All of this websites code is on my

            </h5>

            <div class="pbold">What is karsix.io?</div>
            <p>
                It was meant to be a sandbox for me to work on
                my skills as a programmer, but it has turned
                into a website featuring info about me and my
                projects.
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">Why did I create karsix.io?</div>
            <p>
                Towards the end of my 2019 Summer, I wanted to build an online portfolio
                to take the skills I had learned about Web Development and User Experience
                from my Freshman classes and put them to practical use. I went through many
                iterations of this website, in a few different frameworks, and what you are
                seeing is the culmination of those iterations!
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">Why did I choose karsix.io as my domain name?</div>
            <p>
                I was toying around many domain names when I first started thinking about
                creating this website, many of which were related to my name. I decided
                that I wanted to completely rebrand myself and come up with a new username
                that I could use for my domain, and for my usernames. With some creative spark,
                and with the first initials of my whole name (k.a.r.) along with taking my
                favorite number (6), I came up with the karsix as a new username/domain name.
                I chose .io as my top level domain because it seemed “techy” and because
                it seemed to flow well with my domain.
            </p>

            <h2>Karsix.io - How did I go about with creating karsix.io?</h2>

            <div class="pbold">Forward Thinking with User Experience</div>
            <p>
                I realized from my experience in the User Experience program at MSOE that
                I needed to plan out the website first instead of jumping into coding, to
                avoid mistakes and streamline the design process. With a little research,
                and a lot of design iterations, I created a site map and a few wireframes
                for this website that I thought looked great using Balsamiq.
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">Designing with Balsamiq</div>
            <p>
                I found Balsamiq a very quick and effective tool to use to create designs,
                when time is of the essence. I enjoyed using Balsamiq but wished that the tool
                allowed for more customizability with designs instead of having to use their
                preset elements. I found that I did not need to learn how to use the tool
                because of my experience with wireframing through another tool, Adobe XD.
                In Adobe XD, I had to create each design from scratch, but with Balsamiq,
                I could just search for an element, like a button, and just place it in,
                which made life a lot easier!
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">Creating a Site Map</div>
            <p>
                A site map is essentially a blueprint of the navigation of the website.
                It was necessary to come up with a site map so I could organize my page layout
                and know where all of the information was going.
            </p>

            <img src="../../images/projects/sitemap.png" style="min-width:80%" class="fleximage" alt="The final iteration of the sitemap" />
            <h5>The final iteration of the Site Map.</h5>
            <br>

            <div class="pbold">Creating Wireframes</div>
            <p>
                During the wireframing process I experienced a lot of difficulty with
                creating wireframes, because the ideas I had in my head were too complicated
                for my coding expertise and I also did not have the time to spend to learn
                these skills. I had to tone down my design to meet my skills while also
                creating a simple and visually appealing responsive site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below you will find two wireframes that I have created, the first being my 
                homepage which I was able to code to match the wireframe perfectly. The second 
                is a template for articles on my site, specifically it was meant for the 
                Discovery World Article. In the end I could not match the exact placement of 
                the elements in the wireframe due to it being much harder to make the site 
                responsive if I had two columns, which is why I chose a simpler approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, I still decided to show the second wireframe because it shows how User 
                Experience + Design is an iterative process that is continuous. Maybe someday 
                I will be able to create my site to match that wireframe, but with my toolset 
                right now, I have come up with what you are seeing on this site right now.
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">A Learning Experience</div>
            <p>
                Through the iterations of creating sitemaps and wireframes, I realized
                that this was just a design phrase. The idea of designing before solving
                can be used throughout industry, whether it be creating blueprints for a
                house or whiteboarding code prior to implementing it, designing can help
                any project and should always be a part of the project.
            </p>

            <h2>Design Rationale for Karsix.io</h2>

            <div class="pbold">Tools</div>
            <p>
                When it came to creating this website, I had a lot of options with how I
                could create it. I could have used a website builder, like Weebly or
                Squarespace to create a website or I could have downloaded a website
                template and edited it myself. I decided that I did not want to use
                either of these options and instead, I wanted to create a website
                from scratch using HTML, CSS and JS.
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">Why did I code from scratch?</div>
            <p>
                As a Computer Science student who loves learning new skills, I felt that
                I was up for the challenge and wanted to learn more about responsive design.
                Additionally, it seemed to be a fun project, that I could do in my free time
                while working and attending school, without taking too much of my time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, anyone can create a website from a template, but I wanted to use this 
                site as an example of my work ethic and an example of a project that I created 
                in my free time. The idea was that it would be a selling point during interviews 
                to show my skills, my hardwork and also provide the job recruiter with more 
                information about me.
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">Visitor Analysis</div>
            <p>
                I predicted that the majority of the people who visited my website would
                likely come from either my LinkedIn, my resume,  or from word of mouth,
                typically through a networking session. Hence I geared my site to be an
                extension of my resume to provide more details on my work experience,
                projects I am working on and more importantly, allow the visitors to
                get to know me a little more.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also performed A/B testing on the homepage to determine which version of
                the page retained audience more and provided a less cognitive load (how much
                the user has to think to perform an action) on the user. A/B testing
                essentially is comparing two variations of a web page or app to see which
                variation hits the desired goal. In my case, I tested the home page with a
                button and without a button and found that the use of a call to action button
                significantly reduces the cognitive load of a user and thus retained more users. 
                It may have been a small change in the UI that resulted from A/B testing, but 
                the homepage gained a significant UX improvement.
            </p>
            <div class="pbold">UX and Site Design</div>
            <p>
                I wanted to use the experience I have gained through my User Experience
                classes when I was designing this site, which is why I came up with
                motivations to keep the user engaged in my site and to learn more about
                me. I identified that the main motivations I wanted to express in my
                site was curiosity and affiliation. I wanted the visitor to see my
                projects and activities that I performed and possibly draw connections
                to projects and activities they perform in their free time, which is why
                I put such a big emphasis on my Experiences and Projects. I also wanted to
                promote curiosity in my website with the intent that the user wants to
                learn more about me and possibly reach out to me via my contact page.
