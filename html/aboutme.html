            <h5>and yes, that is a picture of 7 year old me, with a killer haircut!</h5>

            <div class="pbold">Who am I?</div>
            <p>
                My name is Kyle Rodrigues, and I am currently a Sophomore at Milwaukee School of 
                Engineering. I am majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Artificial Intelligence 
                along with minoring in User Experience and Math.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am 20 years old and am natively from India. I currently reside in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
                but I have spent the majority of my life in Chicago, Illinois.
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">What are my Hobbies?</div>
            <p>
                Apart from participating in clubs at MSOE (see Experience page), I enjoy playing sports like 
                Volleyball and Basketball. I love going to the gym and lifting, although I try to stay away 
                from cardio as much as possible :)
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy taking my skills that I am learning in class and apply them to self projects 
                (like this site), which is why I can be found coding at most times of the day. I also 
                have been trying to find time to learn new skills like JavaScript and Machine Learning, but 
                with my packed schedule, it can be hard to find time to learn these skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been an avid reader from a young age, and while I do not have the time to read as much, 
                you can typically find me reading Fantasy/Mystery novels in my free time. I also enjoy binging TV 
                Series, my favorites being: Sherlock, Gotham and Game of Thrones (RIP last season).
            </p>
            <p>
                While I don’t spend as much time gaming as I used to do when I was a child, I still love to do it! 
                My favorite video games are: The Witcher 3, R6, LoL and Minecraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have found that I love Sushi!
            </p>
            <div class="pbold">What are my Future Plans</div>
            <p>
                I love to travel and have been kicking around the idea of doing a trip to either Europe or 
                Japan. I am leaning towards visiting Japan since I really enjoy the culture and the food, and 
                have been learning Japanese in my free time to prepare for a trip in the future.
