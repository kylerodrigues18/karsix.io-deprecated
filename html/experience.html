            <div class="pbold">Cognex - Software Engineering Intern (Jan, 2019 - now)</div>
            <p>
                Cognex, in a nutshell, is a manufacturing company that creates machine 
                vision products (like high tech sensors). I personally work on the maintenance of 
                current Machine Vision product software.
            </p>
            <P>
                While working at Cognex, I have worked on various projects as part of 
                an Agile Scrum team. My favorite project to date was creating an automated 
                analytic dashboard using C# and ASP.NET Core MVC to display the results of our 
                automated tests.
            </P>
            <p>
                Cognex has one of the best cultures that I have seen and it is clear that 
                the company values it employees. Every month we have company outings along 
                with the interns playing sports like Basketball and Ultimate Frisbee during 
                most days of the summer. Additionally working as an intern is great because the 
                Milwaukee branch office has around 1 intern for every 3 full time employees, 
                so I have a lot of support and help whenever I get stuck (which tends to happen a lot). 
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">HDR - Architecture Intern (Jun 2017 - Aug 2017)</div>
            <p>
                HDR is engineering and architecture firm that works on a variety of projects 
                across the US and in many countries. While I was interning at HDR, I worked 
                closely with other Architects on designing for medical spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn’t necessarily have a favorite project while working at HDR, but I really enjoyed 
                learning how to use Revit and Rhino (CAD software) and applying my knowledge to 
                create models and renderings. I also enjoyed going on site visits and seeing how our designs 
                were turning out!
            </p>
            <p>
                I also loved working in the heart of Chicago, along with having a good view across the city. 
                Oh, and the food was pretty good also :)
            </p>

            <h2>User Experience</h2>

            <div class="pbold">What have I learned about UX design?</div>
            <p>
                    The most important idea I have picked up through my classes on User 
                    Experience is that UX is an iterative process that shouldn’t be a one 
                    and done thing. Teams should always be actively looking on how to improve 
                    their product and UX is a continuous process that can be used in all stages 
                    of the development of their product.
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">How has my ideas about UX changed?</div>
            <p>
                    Entering into the UX program, I had a solid idea that User Experience 
                    and User Interface Design was the same thing, but realized very quickly 
                    that UI design was just a small part of UX and that their was so much 
                    more to learn about UX that I would have never thought related to UX.
            </p>
            
            <div class="pbold">How is UX useful to me?</div>
            <p>
                    As a Computer Science major, I typically work on projects that involve 
                    some sort of physical aspect, whether that be a UI or hardware of some sort. 
                    I have noticed that I spend more time coding than worrying about how the 
                    end user will use my product and how they will interact with the UI or 
                    hardware. After taking UX classes, I learned very quickly that I had to 
                    always have the end user in mind and how they want to use the app 
                    along with how I want them to use the app. With this thought process, I can 
                    provide better software and products that not only benefit society, but 
                    also improves my candidacy for future jobs and projects.
