                It was meant to be a sandbox for me to work on
                my skills as a programmer, but it has turned 
                into a website featuring info about me and my
                projects.

            <div class="pbold">HDR - Architecture Intern (Jun 2017 - Aug 2017)</div>
            <p>
                Towards the end of my 2019 Summer, I wanted to build an online portfolio 
                to take the skills I had learned about Web Development and User Experience 
                from my Freshman classes and put them to practical use. I went through many 
                iterations of this website, in a few different frameworks, and what you are 
                seeing is the culmination of those iterations!
            </p>
            
            <h2>Education</h2>

            <div class="pbold">Milwaukee School of Engineering</div>
            <p>
                I realized from my experience in the User Experience program at MSOE that 
                I needed to plan out the website first instead of jumping into coding, to 
                avoid mistakes and streamline the design process. With a little research, 
                and a lot of design iterations, I created a site map and a few wireframes 
                for this website that I thought looked great using Balsamiq.

            <h2>User Experience</h2>

            <div class="pbold">What have I learned about UX design?</div>
            <p>
                    The most important idea I have picked up through my classes on User 
                    Experience is that UX is an iterative process that shouldn’t be a one 
                    and done thing. Teams should always be actively looking on how to improve 
                    their product and UX is a continuous process that can be used in all stages 
                    of the development of their product.
            </p>

            <div class="pbold">How has my ideas about UX changed?</div>
            <p>
                    Entering into the UX program, I had a solid idea that User Experience 
                    and User Interface Design was the same thing, but realized very quickly 
                    that UI design was just a small part of UX and that their was so much 
                    more to learn about UX that I would have never thought related to UX.
            </p>
            
            <div class="pbold">How is UX useful to me?</div>
            <p>
                    As a Computer Science major, I typically work on projects that involve 
                    some sort of physical aspect, whether that be a UI or hardware of some sort. 
                    I have noticed that I spend more time coding than worrying about how the 
                    end user will use my product and how they will interact with the UI or 
                    hardware. After taking UX classes, I learned very quickly that I had to 
                    always should have the end user in mind and how they want to use the app 
                    along with how I want them to use the app. With this thought process, I 
                    provide better software and products that not only benefits society, but 
                    also improves my candidacy for future jobs and projects.
